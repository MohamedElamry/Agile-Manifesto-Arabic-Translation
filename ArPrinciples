  Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
we_follow
  We follow these principles:
principle_1
  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer<br>
  through early and continuous delivery<br>
  of valuable software.
principle_2
  Welcome changing requirements, even late in <br>
  development. Agile processes harness change for <br>
  the customer's competitive advantage.
principle_3
  Deliver working software frequently, from a <br>
  couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a <br>
  preference to the shorter timescale.
principle_4
  Business people and developers must work <br>
  together daily throughout the project.
principle_5
  Build projects around motivated individuals. <br>
  Give them the environment and support they need, <br>
  and trust them to get the job done.
principle_6
  The most efficient and effective method of <br>
  conveying information to and within a development <br>
  team is face-to-face conversation.
principle_7
  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
principle_8
  Agile processes promote sustainable development. <br>
  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able <br>
  to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
principle_9
  Continuous attention to technical excellence <br>
  and good design enhances agility.
principle_10
  Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount <br>
  of work not done--is essential.
principle_11
  The best architectures, requirements, and designs <br>
  emerge from self-organizing teams.
principle_12
  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how <br>
  to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts <br>
  its behavior accordingly.
